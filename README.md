# WEEK-ONE-REPORT
WEEK ONE REPORT
Officially Industrial training (IPT) was started on 30TH July 2018. This is my weekly report of progress during IPT and this is for week one ended  4th July 2018 .

Most of the time for this week I spend on reading books such as Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow chapter 1 to 4 ” and  "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python chapter 1,2 and 4"  also  online courses on Foundation of Machine Learning by sambaiga ML by Andrew Ng week 1, 2 and 3 and Data-driven Decision Making and  Other source  you tube tutorial about machine learning and lecture from different web sites in order to get the clear picture what  machine learning is all about.
The general concept I got from there was different definition on how scientist tries to define what is machine learning such as In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".

Apart from general concept and definition of machine learning, Machine learning system can be classified according to amount and type of supervision they get during Training. I scanning three of them and its characteristics and usage. That’s are 

1.	Supervised learning 

Here we training data to algorithm include the desire solution called labels Some important supervised learning algorithm is. 

a.	K-nearest neighbor
b.	Linear Regression
c.	Logistic Regression 
d.	Logistic Regression
e.	Decision trees and Random Forest 
f.	Neural networks

2.	Unsupervised learning

Here the system tries to learn without teacher. Some algorithm and tactics used are 

a.	Cluster algorithm 
b.	Visualization algorithm 
c.	Dimensional Reduction 
d.	Anomaly detection

3.	Rain-Forcement   learning 

The learning system called an agent in this context can observe an environment select and perform an action and get reward in return follow the sequence like this.
Observe =>Select action =>Action =>Get reward or penalty =>Update police 
=>Iterate until the optimal police is found.

Also I previewed the important part of machine learning that is Deep Learning a subclass of machine learning algorithms that learn underlying features in data using multiple processing layers with multiple levels of abstraction.
Deep learning success in different areas in our daily real life. Some example are Object Classification ,Detection, Image Captioning ,Image Style Transfer ,Self _driving car ,Drones ,Cyberattack prediction ,Game ,Machine translation , Speech Processing ,Music composition ,Automatic Text Generation  and Predict heart disease risk from eye scans

   Apart from that.
Anaconda installation and attempting week one challenge to determine whether the student will drop or continue to school due to the given data of a student in a dataset wasa part of week one.

Special thanks to: 
               Samnbaga and all student who support me to attend this amazing course
